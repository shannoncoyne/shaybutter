# [shaybutter.net](http://www.shaybutter.net/ "shaybutter.net")

This is my near term current projects list/blog while I get shannoncoyne.com up and
running. In the long term, I wish to make shaybutter.net my blog for cool things
I learn about dev/design, and shannoncoyne.com more of a personal project and
portfolio hub.
